### 1. AIOps with Splunk and Event-Driven Ansible

**File:** [README-AIOps-Splunk-ITSI.md](README-AIOps-Splunk-ITSI.md)
**Score: 8.9 / 10**

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Outcome Clarity (20%) | 5 |
| Architecture Clarity (20%) | 4 |
| Technical Executability (25%) | 4 |
| Validation/Testability (15%) | 5 |
| Production Readiness (10%) | 4 |
| Business Framing (10%) | 5 |

**Stats:** ~6,800 words | 15 YAML blocks | 1 architecture image + 2 textual flow diagrams | 17 walkthrough subsections

**Strengths:**
- Three integration patterns (ITSI/MLTK, generic webhook, network OSPF) in a single guide with a repeatable story
- Deep Splunk operational detail -- MLTK adaptive-interval behavior, aggregation policy pitfalls, ITSI source field nuances
- Unusually thorough validation: per-stage checklists, scripted webhook injection, OSPF scenario matrix, and a wide troubleshooting sheet
- Closed-loop completeness from detect through correlate, enrich, remediate, and episode closure
- Strong business framing with retail KPI severity scenario and persona table anchored to measurable pain

**Weaknesses:**
- TOC includes "Incident Response Timeline" with no matching section (dead anchor)
- Same `aiops_splunk_predict.png` reused for the webhook pipeline section -- risks confusing readers
- Phase 1 of the ITSI remediation playbook is placeholder text; not all referenced collections appear in Prerequisites
- Missing KB blockquote under the title per repo convention

**Suggestions:**
1. Fix or remove the dead "Incident Response Timeline" TOC entry
2. Provide a distinct diagram (or clear caption) separating predictive ITSI topology from generic webhook flow
3. Unify Prerequisites with every module used in excerpts (add `f5networks.f5_modules`, `amazon.aws`)

### 2. Automated Incident Remediation with IBM Instana

**File:** [README-Instana-AIOps.md](README-Instana-AIOps.md)
**Score: 8.9 / 10**

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Outcome Clarity (20%) | 4 |
| Architecture Clarity (20%) | 5 |
| Technical Executability (25%) | 4 |
| Validation/Testability (15%) | 5 |
| Production Readiness (10%) | 4 |
| Business Framing (10%) | 5 |

**Stats:** ~4,300 words | 8 YAML blocks | 2 ASCII flow diagrams | 8 numbered steps + 3 use cases + optional AI section

**Strengths:**
- Two integration patterns (EDA webhook vs Instana native automation framework) with "when to use which" comparison table
- Concrete integration surface: webhook URL/payload field table, full rulebook, Host Agent REST annotation loop
- Per-stage and per-use-case operational impact levels, rollback warnings, and approval-gate maturity guidance
- Strong validation: checklist-by-stage verification, deterministic synthetic POST test, and troubleshooting grid
- Business + engineering alignment: personas, demos, ROI recap, and measurable success metric table

**Weaknesses:**
- "Integration Architecture" section name deviates from the framework's standard "[Topic] Workflow" convention
- Minor typo: "an governed" should be "a governed" in the Overview
- DB idle-connection playbook excerpt stops short of showing the full kill-query step
- Relies on ASCII diagrams only -- a formal architecture image would aid readability

**Suggestions:**
1. Fix the "an governed" typo in the Overview
2. Add a subtitle or alias so "Integration Architecture" maps to the framework's Workflow section for reviewers
3. Add one formal diagram image (even a simple Mermaid export) for the dual-path topology

### 3. High-Availability AAP with EDB PostgreSQL DR

**File:** [README-EDB.md](README-EDB.md)
**Score: 8.7 / 10**

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Outcome Clarity (20%) | 4.5 |
| Architecture Clarity (20%) | 5 |
| Technical Executability (25%) | 4 |
| Validation/Testability (15%) | 4 |
| Production Readiness (10%) | 4 |
| Business Framing (10%) | 4.5 |

**Stats:** ~7,130 words | 1 YAML block | 4 major ASCII diagrams | 6 phases, 23 titled substeps

**Strengths:**
- Reference-grade architecture: layered diagrams (dual-DC topology, steady-state data flow, failover timeline, network layout) plus sizing and component tables
- Operational honesty about failover impact on sessions, in-flight jobs, EDA activations, and DNS TTL
- End-to-end scope from infrastructure provisioning through production cutover, plus an Operational Runbook section
- Strong validation surface: per-stage checklist, health-check scripts, failback procedure, and troubleshooting table
- Clear "Who Benefits" and Crawl/Walk/Run tables connecting engineering work to stakeholder language

**Weaknesses:**
- Unified INI inventory example for DC2 may have grouping issues that could cause install failures if copied literally
- Failover testing alternates between `pg_ctl promote` and EFM-orchestrated behavior without a clear single authority
- Unlike other AAP guides, there is no featured Automation Hub collection table (fine for the topic, but a convention gap)
- Missing KB blockquote under the title

**Suggestions:**
1. Validate and fix the unified inventory INI grouping so DC2 host/variable assignments are unambiguous
2. Add a short "Support and boundaries" note clarifying Red Hat vs EDB support scope
3. For 3-5 key commands (`podman ps`, `efm cluster-status`, `pg_is_in_recovery`), show verbatim expected output

### 4. AIOps automation with Ansible

**File:** [README-AIOps.md](README-AIOps.md)
**Score: 8.5 / 10** *(updated May 2026 after adding Red Hat Lightspeed content and terminology updates)*

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Outcome Clarity (20%) | 4 |
| Architecture Clarity (20%) | 5 |
| Technical Executability (25%) | 4 |
| Validation/Testability (15%) | 3 |
| Production Readiness (10%) | 4.5 |
| Business Framing (10%) | 4.5 |

**Stats:** ~7,500 words | 8 YAML blocks | 6+ substantive workflow/concept images | 4 pipeline phases with 16 numbered substeps

**Strengths:**
- Strong systems narrative: clear contrast between deterministic EDA scaling and AI-in-the-middle architecture
- Risk-aware layering with operational impact matrix and Crawl/Walk/Run framing
- Eight YAML examples spanning rulebooks, AI completions, URIs, git publish, and dynamic AAP resources
- Comprehensive reference tables for event types, observability tools, message queues, and AI endpoints
- Boundary-oriented troubleshooting table fills a gap most architecture docs skip
- New "Where Do Good Playbooks Come From?" section maps four playbook sources (Red Hat Lightspeed CVE, Advisor, RHEL System Roles, Automation code assistant) to maturity stages
- Terminology update blockquote clarifies Ansible Lightspeed / Red Hat Insights rebranding inline

**Weaknesses:**
- Validation is organized by stage but lacks verbatim sample outputs -- weaker as a standalone cookbook
- No single explicit "Solution Walkthrough" heading; depth is spread across sections 1-4
- AAP YAML snippets embed HTML emoji in `name` fields, which breaks copy-paste as valid YAML
- Missing KB blockquote under the title per repo convention

**Suggestions:**
1. Add verbatim expected output for each pipeline stage (event body, AI response structure, code assistant JSON)
2. Sanitize YAML examples so template names are plain strings suitable for copy-paste
3. Insert the KB blockquote under the H1 per publishing standards

### 5. AI Infrastructure automation with Ansible

**File:** [README-IA.md](README-IA.md)
**KB Article:** [access.redhat.com/articles/7118390](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7118390)
**Score: 7.3 / 10**

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Outcome Clarity (20%) | 4 |
| Architecture Clarity (20%) | 4 |
| Technical Executability (25%) | 4 |
| Validation/Testability (15%) | 3 |
| Production Readiness (10%) | 3 |
| Business Framing (10%) | 3 |

**Stats:** ~1,927 words | 3 YAML blocks | 1 workflow screenshot | ~8-10 major phases

**Strengths:**
- Clear two-collection story (`infra.ai` for provisioning, `redhat.ai` for model serving) with Automation Hub links
- Multiple integration paths: CLI inventory vs AAP EC2 sync, curl vs Ansible module for validation
- Honest scope note that AWS is an example while `infra.ai` supports other targets
- Operational bridge to AAP via workflow template description and screenshot

**Weaknesses:**
- Missing canonical Overview, Prerequisites, and Maturity Path sections per the framework
- `provision.yml` execution is never shown with equivalent clarity to the `ilab.yml` example
- Validation has no verbatim expected output and no troubleshooting table
- No persona table, no quantified business pain, and lighter production framing than the topic warrants

**Suggestions:**
1. Add an Overview section with a problem statement and a consolidated Prerequisites table
2. Show `provision.yml` execution alongside `ilab.yml` (or the AAP job settings equivalent)
3. Expand Validation with sample success output and a 3-5 row troubleshooting table

### 6. Reducing MTTR with ServiceNow Ticket Enrichment

**File:** [README-AIOps-ServiceNow.md](README-AIOps-ServiceNow.md)
**Score: 7.1 / 10**

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Outcome Clarity (20%) | 4 |
| Architecture Clarity (20%) | 3 |
| Technical Executability (25%) | 3 |
| Validation/Testability (15%) | 4 |
| Production Readiness (10%) | 4 |
| Business Framing (10%) | 4 |

**Stats:** ~1,762 words | 0 YAML blocks | 1 ASCII flow diagram | 4 walkthrough steps

**Strengths:**
- Clear positioning of LEAP + MCP as the bridge between ServiceNow's "system of work" and AAP's "system of execution"
- Dedicated security/governance section covering least privilege, approved job templates, change control, and audit alignment
- Good persona table mapping roles to pain and value
- Validation checkpoints mirror the actual integration lifecycle (token, connector, opportunity mapping, execution)
- Ecosystem links to Automation Hub collections, Red Hat topic pages, Arcade demo, and related guides

**Weaknesses:**
- Zero YAML and no example job template, survey, inventory limit, or `servicenow.itsm` follow-up pattern
- Architecture relies on one ASCII diagram and bullets -- MCP deployment topology and auth flow are not deep enough
- "Workflow" section renamed to "End-to-End Architecture" which diverges from the framework
- Validation is qualitative ("visible in AAP") without sample outputs or API calls

**Suggestions:**
1. Add 2 YAML excerpts: a minimal job template definition and a `servicenow.itsm` enrichment task
2. Add one sequence or component diagram clarifying MCP hosting, network path, and trust boundaries
3. Paste one verbatim success artifact (sanitized AAP job output or connector status text) per checkpoint

### 7. Intelligent Assistant with Red Hat AI Inference Server

**File:** [README-Intelligent-Assistant-RHAIIS.md](README-Intelligent-Assistant-RHAIIS.md)
**KB Article:** [access.redhat.com/articles/7130595](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7130595)
**Score: 6.9 / 10**

| Category | Score |
|----------|-------|
| Outcome Clarity (20%) | 4 |
| Architecture Clarity (20%) | 3 |
| Technical Executability (25%) | 3 |
| Validation/Testability (15%) | 4 |
| Production Readiness (10%) | 3 |
| Business Framing (10%) | 4 |

**Stats:** ~1,625 words | 0 YAML blocks (2 YAML snippets in `~~~` fences) | Arcade demo + 1 GPU screenshot | ~12-14 major operations

**Strengths:**
- Tight integration target: connects RHAIIS container flags required for Lightspeed (`--enable-auto-tool-choice`, `--tool-call-parser`)
- Actionable OpenShift wiring: Kubernetes `Secret` keys and AAP CR `spec.lightspeed` fields
- Concrete validation with curl test to `/v1/completions` and expected answer text
- Rich Arcade demo embed for visual learners
- Cross-links to the collection-based RHEL AI deployment path (README-IA.md)

**Weaknesses:**
- Missing framework sections: no Overview, Solution (components/personas), Workflow/Architecture, or Maturity Path
- No formal architecture diagram showing GPU host, inference server, AAP/OCP, and Lightspeed flow
- `podman run` formatting may break on copy-paste due to line continuation issues
- YAML snippets use `~~~` fences instead of ` ```yaml `, reducing syntax highlighting consistency

**Suggestions:**
1. Add an Overview with problem statement and a Workflow section with a simple diagram
2. Fix `podman run` shell formatting for unambiguous line continuation; convert `~~~` to ` ```yaml `
3. Add a Validation heading with a troubleshooting table (common failures: connectivity, 401/403, OOM/GPU, wrong URL path)

## Cross-Cutting Observations

**Patterns that work well across guides:**
- Automation Hub links for every collection mentioned
- Per-step operational impact ratings (EDB, Instana, Splunk)
- Persona mapping by stakeholder role (AIOps, Instana, ServiceNow, EDB)
- Crawl/Walk/Run maturity model with specific milestones per guide
- Blockquote callouts following the short-header-then-body convention

**Recurring gaps across most guides:**
1. **KB blockquote under the title** -- Most guides do not place the `access.redhat.com` link in a blockquote directly under H1 per repo convention
2. **Verbatim validation output** -- Most guides describe success indicators but do not show literal expected output
3. **Framework section naming** -- Several guides rename or omit canonical section names (Workflow, Solution Walkthrough, Prerequisites)
4. **YAML copy-paste fidelity** -- Some guides embed HTML, emoji, or formatting in YAML that breaks literal reuse
5. **Architecture diagrams** -- ASCII flows are common; formal diagram images are rare outside AIOps and EDB

**Ranking rationale:**
- Splunk and Instana tie at 8.9 but Splunk edges ahead on breadth (three use cases) while Instana leads on validation rigor
- EDB at 8.7 is the deepest single-topic guide with the most operational runbook content
- AIOps at 8.1 is the strongest foundational reference but held back by validation depth
- IA (7.3) and ServiceNow (7.1) are solid but need framework alignment and more executable artifacts
- RHAIIS (6.9) is the most hands-on procedural guide but weakest on framework structure
